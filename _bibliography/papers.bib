abstract = {Against the background of an ageing structure stock and the constant increase in heavy traffic, frequent structural inspections of high quality are indispensable. In accomplishing this task, the use of digital methods within the framework of digitized inspections (DIs) offers great potential for improvement in terms of cost-effectiveness and quality. An essential component of DIs is the automated detection of damage with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). As part of the research project “Model-Based Digital Structural Inspection – MoBaP”, CNNs are being trained at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich for the classification of defects occurring on concrete bridges. On this domain's currently largest open-source dataset (CODEBRIM), the best CNN achieves an exact match ratio of 74 % and thus currently defines a strong baseline. In order to also train neural networks for object detection and semantic segmentation in this domain, a separate dataset is created. This enables not only the classification but also the localisation of damage on images. In this paper, the authors discuss the procedure of training neural networks for the classification of defects on concrete bridges and show a detailed analysis of test results. In addition, the development and current status of their own dataset is presented.},
