I’m currently working on recognizing reinforced concrete defects and bridge components. Recognizing means the classification, measurement and localization of each visually distinguishable defect/component. Thereby, I combine my passion for new techniques (e.g., Deep Learning) and my structural analysis/building materials knowledge to continue improving processes such as structural inspections.</p> </body></html>
