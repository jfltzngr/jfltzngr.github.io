Hi, Iâ€™m Johannes, a PhD candidate at UniBw who loves tackling computer vision problems in the civil engineering domain. I'm currently working on recognizing reinforced concrete defects and bridge components. Recognizing means the classification, measurement and localization of each visually distinguishable defect/component. Thereby, I combine my passion for new techniques (e.g., Deep Learning) and my structural analysis/building materials knowledge to continue improving processes such as structural inspections.
