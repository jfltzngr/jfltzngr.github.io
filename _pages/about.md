Hi, I’m Johannes, a PhD candidate at UniBw who loves tackling computer vision problems in the civil engineering domain. I'm currently working on recognizing reinforced concrete defects and bridge components. Recognizing means the classification, measurement and localization of each visually distinguishable defect and building component. 
Thereby, I combine my passion for new techniques (e.g., Deep Learning) and my structural analysis/building materials knowledge to continue improving processes such as structural inspections. 

I am part of the dacl-squad. dacl is the acronym for damage classification and our mascot. Furthermore, it is important to note that dacl is associated with the german word "Dackel" which can be translated as dachshound, sausage dog or wiener dog.
