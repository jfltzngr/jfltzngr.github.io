Hi, Iâ€™m Johannes, a PhD candidate at UniBw who loves tackling computer vision problems in the civil engineering domain. I'm currently working on recognizing defects and building components of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges, dams, power plants, ...). Recognizing means the classification, measurement and localization of each visually distinguishable defect and building component. 
Thereby, I combine my passion for Deep Learning and my Structural Analysis/Building Materials knowledge to improve the inspection process. 

I am founder of the dacl-squad. dacl is the acronym for damage classification and our mascot. Furthermore, it is important to note that dacl is associated with the german word "Dackel" which can be translated as dachshound, sausage dog or wiener dog.

If you are interested in colaborating do not hesitate and hit me up! Next, I want to focus on the damage localization problem. I have some ideas originating from the fields of computer vision and geoinformatics. In case you have expertise in these fields please hesitate even less to reach out.
